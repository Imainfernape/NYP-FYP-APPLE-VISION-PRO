Sorry if the repository is kinda badly done (idk how to do branches and whatnot)
Not really sure how to do the Github repository stuff so I just uploaded the whole project folder in and called it a day.
Sorry for any inconvenience x-x
(Also, I'm not really sure how to share this considering that I don't know who will take over, so I made the repository public. So, sorry if that causes any incovenience too. Just fork it or something I guess.)
